# Contributing to Vigie

Vigie welcomes contribution from everyone in the form of suggestions, bug reports, pull requests, and feedback. This document gives some guidance if you are thinking of helping me.

## How to Contribute

---

### Reporting Bugs

If you've found a bug or an issue with Vigie, i would appreciate if you could:

1. **Search Existing Issues**: Please check the issues page to see if your bug has already been reported. If it has, feel free to add additional information as a comment.
2. **Create a New Issue**: If the issue hasn’t been reported, create a new issue with the following details:
   - A clear title describing the bug.
   - Steps to reproduce the bug.
   - Expected behavior and what actually happened.
   - Relevant environment details (OS, Rust version, etc.).
   - Any other relevant information or screenshots.

### Suggesting Features or Enhancements

I'm always open to new ideas! If you have a feature or enhancement request, please:

1. **Search Existing Feature Requests**: Look through the existing issues to see if someone has already suggested a similar feature.
2. **Open a New Feature Request**: If your idea hasn’t been suggested yet, open a new issue describing:
   - The motivation for the feature.
   - How you envision the feature working.
   - Any additional context or examples that would be helpful.

### Pull Requests

I welcome pull requests for bug fixes, new features, or improvements! Here’s how you can contribute:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by [forking the repository](https://github.com/curiousmindflow/Vigie/fork) and cloning it locally.

```
git clone https://github.com/curiousmindflow/Vigie.git
cd Vigie
```

2. **Create a New Branch**: Always create a new branch for your changes.

```
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
```

3. **Make Changes**: Implement your changes, making sure your code follows the project’s style and is well-documented.

4. **Test Your Changes**: If applicable, run the tests to ensure your changes don’t break anything. Add new tests if you’ve added a new feature or fixed a bug.

```
cargo test
```

5. **Use Conventional Commits**: I follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification for commit messages. This ensures that commit messages are structured and informative. The format is:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

For example:

```
feat(protocol): add new QoS support
fix(realization): resolve issue with remote socket closed
```

Common types include:

- **feat**: A new feature.
- **fix**: A bug fix.
- **docs**: Documentation-only changes.
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.).
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
- **test**: Adding or modifying tests.
  If your changes introduce a breaking change, add an exclamation mark (!) after the type:

```
feat(protocol)!: change existing Effect
```

Breaking changes should also be mentioned in the commit body or footer for clarity.

6. **Commit and Push**: Commit your changes with a meaningful message and push your branch.

```
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push origin my-feature-branch
```

7. **Create a Pull Request**: Go to the GitHub page of your forked repo and click on “New Pull Request”. In your pull request, provide a detailed explanation of your changes, referencing the issue if applicable.

### Code guidelines

- **Follow Rust’s Style**: Ensure your code follows Rust’s conventions. You can use cargo fmt to automatically format your code.
- **Document Your Code**: Ensure that all public items (functions, structs, modules) have proper Rustdoc comments.
- **Write Tests**: When adding new functionality, write tests to ensure the new code works as expected.
